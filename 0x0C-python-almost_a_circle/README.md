This directory contains review work on Python import, exceptions, class, private attribute, getter/setter, class method, static method, inheritance, unittest, read/write file and new work with args, kwards, serialization/deserialization, JSON.

0. Writing unittests for all tasks for test driven development
1. Creating a class Base with private class attribute and init method
2. Creating class Rectangle that inherits from Base with private instance attributes width, height, x, and y
3. Update Rectangle class to validate all setter methods
4. Update Rectangle class by adding public method to calculate area for Rectangle instance
5. Update Rectangle class by adding public method to display rectangle using '#' character
6. Update Rectangle class so __str__ method returns string [Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>
7. Update Rectangle class to improve public method to display by using x and y as offsets
8. Update Rectangle class by adding public method update that assigns an argument to each attribute
9. Update Rectangle class by changing arguments to key-worded arguments and using kwargs to set attributes
10. Writing Square class that inherits from Rectangle with call to super class in init and new __str__ method returning square-specific string
11. Update Square class with public getter and setter size
12. Update Square class by adding public method to use key-worded arguments to assign attributes
13. Update Rectangle class to return dictionary representationof a Rectangle
14. Update Square class to return dictionary representationof a Square
15. Update Base class by adding static method to return JSON string representation of list_dictionaries
16. Update Base class by adding static method to return JSON string representation of list_objs
17. Update Base class by adding static method to return JSON string representation of json_string
18. Update Base class by adding class method that returns an instance with all attributes already set
19. Update Base class by adding class method to return list of instances
