# 0x09-python-everything_is_object
This directory contains work with understanding Python objects, including both immutable and mutable types:

0. Determining the Python function used to print the type of an object

1. Determining the Python function used to get the variable identifier/memory address in CPython

2-5. Determining if given lines of code with two variables point to the same object

6-13. Determining the differences between '==' and 'is' for different object types

14-18. Determining how changing one variable or calling a function changes a variable through exploring mutability

19. Writing a Python function that returns a copy of a list within 3 lines of code

20-23. Determining if given object is a tuple or another type

24-26. Further determining if variables point to the same object, specifically looking at tuple-like objects

27-28. Determining how altering an object affects its id

[numbers skipped to account for non-coding tasks]

35. Determining how string objects are cleared before and after del is called
