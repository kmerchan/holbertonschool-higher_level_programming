This directory contains initial work with writing tests in Python and accounting for edge cases:
0. Writing a function that adds 2 integers and an interactive test file to check for edge cases
1. Writing a function that divides all elements of a matrix and an interactive test file to check for edge cases
2. Writing a function that prints first and last name as strings and an interactive test file to check for edge cases
3. Writing a function that prints a square with the "#" character and an interactive test file to check for edge cases
4. Writing a function that prints a text string with 2 new lines after certain characters and an interactive test file to check for edge cases
