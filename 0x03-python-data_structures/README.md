This directory contains initial work with Python lists and tuples:

0. Writing a Python function to print all integers of a list using str.format()
1. Writing a Python function that retrieves an element from a list at a given index
2. Writing a Python function that replaces an element of a list at a given index
3. Writing a Python function that prints all elements of a list in reverse order using str.format()
4. Writing a Python function that replaces an element in a list at a given index without modifying the original list
5. Writing a Python function to remove all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string
6. Writing a Python function that prints a matrix of integers using str.format()
7. Writing a Python function that adds two tuples
8. Writing a Python function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character
9. Writing a Python function that finds the biggest integer of a list
10. Writing a Python function that finds all multiples of two in a list
11. Writing a Python function that deletes an item at a given index in a list without using pop()
12. Completing Python source code to switch the value of variables a and b in exactly 5 lines
13. Technical Interview Preparation:
