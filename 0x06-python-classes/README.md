This directory contains initial work with Python classes:

0. Writing an empty class 'Square' that defines a square
1. Writing a class 'Square' that defines a square by private instance attribute size
2. Writing a class 'Square' that defines a square by private instance attribute size and instantiates that size must be an integer greater than or equal to 0
3. Writing a class 'Square' that defines a square by private instance attribute size, instantiates size, and creates public instance method to calculate area
4. Writing a class 'Square' that defines a square by private instance attribute size, sets property of size, optionally instantiates size, and creates public instance method to calculate area
5. Writing a class 'Square' that defines a square by private instance attribute size, sets property of size, optionally instantiates size, and creates public instance methods to calculate area and print the square using '#'
6. Writing a class 'Square' that defines a square by private instance attributes size and position, sets property of size, optionally instantiates size and position, and creates public instance methods to calculate area and print the square using '#'
